# A Group Recommendation System for Music Using Implicit User Feedback

### Abstract
Recommendation systems have been widely equipped in various platforms to provide users with suggestions.
Similarly, a group recommendation system learns and provides suggestion to a group of people. In group events such as dinner parties and small gatherings, music is commonly used for entertainment or self-expression. In this work, the researcher developed a music recommendation system for a group of people using Matrix Factorisation(MF) based Collaborative Filtering. To train the MF model, the researcher utilized the implicit user feedback data by converting to explicit user feedback such as rating. Three group recommendation methods based on the reproduced dataset were also tested, and further evaluated for their performance. Two explanation methods were also designed to inform why a song is recommended and how every group member is represented in the playlist. The research paper concludes with the researcher discussing the limitations including selection bias in the reproduced dataset.
