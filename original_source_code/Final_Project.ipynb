    "# Introduction and Problem Statement: \n",
    "In the past, a lot of effort has been put towards finding the recommendations for a given user in different fields. But many a times it is seen that people like to do certain activities in groups like, camping or watching movies. In such a case there is a need for a recommender which takes care of the interests of each individual of the group and suggests items which are likely to be enjoyed by the entire group. So hereby we present the idea of a Group Recommendation System for movies. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are proposing to implement the idea using Matrix Factorization (MF) based Collaborative Filtering. The main idea of MF models is to factorize the original rating matrix into two or more matrices in order to represent the user-item interactions. We will be using various approaches to calculate these factors for groups using those of individual users."

    "# Related Work:\n",
    "The most popular method to compute recommendations for a group of users is KNN based CF.The data sparsity issues related to KNN can be tackled by using a support vector machine learning model that computes similarities between items. Another approach defines the set of neighbors of the group as the intersection of the sets of neighbors of each user of the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although for single user recommendations, MF based CF has been extensively studied, its implementation for group recommendation has not been carried out in depth. One such approach has been proposed in an earlier paper which modifies the MF model to include a wide variety of sociological factors such as cohesion, social similarity and social centrality."

    "# Approach:\n",
    "The system takes a group size as input, generates random groups and produces movie recommendations based on group members' biases. \n",
    "The following approaches are being used for the same : \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>AF (After factorization) : Here we first factorize user x item matrix and then calculate factors for users. We then aggregate these factors to approximate the factors for the groups of users. Using these group factors, we can calculate group ratings for items based on these factors and biases.</li>\n",
    "<li>BF (Before factorization ) : In BF (before factorization) approach, we aggregate ratings of the users before factorization of ratings matrix and calculate group rating . We can assume group as a virtual user from this step. Now we derive factors and biases for the groups. The idea of ridge regression has been used for this approach.</li>\n",
    "<li>WBF (Weighted BF) : The weighted BF approach is similar to BF method except that here each item is associated with a weight depending upon the number of users who have watched it and how similar are the corresponding ratings. Hence the stochastic gradient minimization function will be different.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Also the different sizes of groups being considered are :\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Small (2-4 users),</li>\n",
    "<li>medium (5-8 users) and  </li>\n",

    "\n",
    "For evaluation, we run all the 3 methods: AF, BF and WBF for 50 randomly generated groups from among the users in the Movielens\n",
    "dataset.\n",
    "These groups are non disjoint in the sense that same user can be present in multiple groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the configuration parameters stated again all at once:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Matrix Factorization hyperparameters__:\n",
    "<li> No. of factors = 15 </li>\n",

    "### Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Precision and Recall for all groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](./res/result.png)\n",
    "    \n",
    "We note that the AF method works best for small groups followed by Weighted before method. \n",
    "For the medium groups as well, this is the case but the margin of difference is lower between the small and medium groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "For larger groups, the WBF method outperforms the AF method and reports better accuracy. Increasing the group size further to very large ( > 15) should further increase the success margin of WBF.\n",
    "\n",
    "We note that BF method (no weights) performs worse than both AF and WBF for all the 3 group sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We note that the recall for methods is pretty low. The low recall values are in keeping with the data reported by the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follwing plot shows the precision vs recall plot of all the 3 methods for large groups. Due to time limitations, plot was evaluated only on 5 sample points (5 iterations over multiple groups.) and hence looks a bit jagged. Plots for other groups can\n",
    "be accessed in the ./res/ subdirectory of github repo.\n",
    "![title](./res/large_grp.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Reason for low recall:\n",
    "Note that we only report top 50 recommendation per group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, since the test data is very sparse, there are lot of movies in our recommendations for which there is no rating data for\n",
    "any member of the group in the test set. Hence, we cannot calculate the precision / recall for these movies as we dont know\n",
    "whether to interpret them as positive or negative matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, our total set of True positives is not known due to sparse data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Comments:\n",
    "Our reported precision metrics match with those reported in the paper. One difference is that author reports far better results for BF and WBF with small and large groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could be attributable to the fact that datasets are different. Author uses Movielens-1MB dataset while we are using 100K\n",
    "dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Author mentions that when the data is sparse, AF performs quite well which is the case in our Movielens 100 K dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is increased, more data is involved in group recommendation process and AF approach does not work properly. A virtual user is better representation for the group of users than the aggregation of users' factors in this case. \n",
    "Both BF and WBF make better recommendations for non-sparse datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar effect is at work when no. of users per group is increased.(more data is involved) In this case too, AF method performs worse gradually than WBF.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__: These reported results have been generated over very large number of iterations. However, the working version of this notebook has very less number of matrix factorization iterations and number of groups to make the time taken for running the code manageable. Hence, the mean precision and recall output by running this notebook may not align exactly with the reported results. Moreover there is random initialization of the factors in matrix factorization which leads to slightly different results different times.\n"

    "### Conclusion and Future Work:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning through hands on experience\n",
    "(a) This was an exciting project and we had a lot of practical learning. We got to know about different Python libraries for data processing (Pandas) and matrix processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "(b) We got an insight into the hyperparameter tuning process and overfitting. Initially, we kept learning rate very high and saw that the mean squared error (MSE) for training data decreased to very low but the MSE for test data kept on increasing. We\n",
    "decreased learning rate and carefully checked for overfitting in the iterations for matrix factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concepts learned in class\n",
    "(a)  We applied matrix factorization technique learned in the course and tried it for a different domain i.e. group recommendations.\n",
    "Since 'group recommendation' is a relatively less explored field (we found very less research papers on it), there is a lot of\n",
    "scope for improvement in the techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Moreover, although we have applied it to movie dataset, the technique of aggregating individual user ratings to evaluate group satisfaction is fairly general and can be applied to other domains, for eg. travel destination suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) We learned that real data is sparse and the traditional metrics. i.e. recall and precision can't be evaluated in all the cases. In these cases, some redefinition of metrics is required for domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) \n",
    "(a) We see that the precision of all the methods is heavily dependent on the initial matrix factorization step. The method of embeddings that we learnt in the class can be used for more accurate matrix factorization. Specifically we can\n",
    "use deep learning based neural networks (CNN) for more accurate matrix factorization. The mean squared error achieved with neural networks is less than normal SGD methods.\n",
    "Given link shows good illustration of this:\n",
    "https://github.com/bradleypallen/keras-movielens-cf/blob/master/MovieLens%201M%20Recommendations.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Improvements\n",
    "In Future, we would like to improve on the following:\n",
    "##### Dataset:\n",
    "We used the movie lens 100K database for this project. We tried for larger Movielens complete dataset of 100 MB entries but\n",
    "could not process this much data due to computational limitations. Matrix Factorization takes a lot of time as the no. of\n",
    "entries increase. Netflix dataset was even larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Better Data Structures:\n",
    "We could try the Sparse Matrix Data Structures given in SciPy in future and store results of different parts of computation\n",
    "as files on disk so that we do matrix factorization only once and reuse the user and item factors over and over.\n",
